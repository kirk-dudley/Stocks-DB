# MS SQL Server Stock Market Project.

Hello!  If you are here, there's a good chance I have applied for a position as a MS SQL DBA/Developer.  Please take a look around!  This is currently a very much in development project, and will change often.

## SSIS, Powershell, and Microsoft SQL Server

The heart of any RDBMS is data.  This project has started with data, and ETL to MSSQL as a start.  The MSSQL side and reporting/data analysis will come very soon!

## Built With

* [MS SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [EODData](https://www.eoddata.com) - While this is a paid data provider, it is fairly inexpensive, and offers a good set of data to use.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs) - Sample Dataset.
